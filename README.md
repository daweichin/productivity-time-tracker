# Productivity Time Tracker

A nodejs / firebase application created in mind to help determine how time is objectively spent - sorted into a few main categories for simplicity.

Main functionality is being able to create labelled sessions (active, passive, relax, etc) and see how much time is spent doing each task.

Initially was built as I wanted to compare how much time i was 'actively' studying as opposed to 'passively' studying. This was important as I found that initially when learning to program i would spend a lot of time passively learning concepts and things due to a lot of high-quality content being available for free on the internet / youtube. As a result, too much time was being spent passively learning and so I built this app as motivation for myself to try and collect data on myself and find a balance between actively programming and passively learning.
